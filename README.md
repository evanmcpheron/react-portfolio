# REACT PORTFOLIO

[HOME PAGE](https://www.emcpheron.com "HOME PAGE")


##### How it works
This portfolio has a hidden page. Type /auth at the end of the url and it'll take you to a login page. I have set the state to automatically give the right password regardless what you type.

##### Steps
- go to [LOGIN PAGE](https://www.emcpheron.com/auth "LOGIN PAGE") and click the login button

- Once you're logged in you can explore the Blog with the rich text editor and the built in portfolio manager.

- Feel free to play around and have some fun with it. All I ask is you delete anything you create after you are finished. :)
